Unit FOAR705.","body":"> Ms. Chumlig had already started.\r\n> \r\n> Search and Analysis was Chumlig's main thing. She used to teach a fast-track version of this at Hoover High, but well-documented rumor held that she just couldn't keep up. So the Department of Education had moved her to the same-named course here at Fairmont. Actually, Juan kind of liked her. She was a failure, too.\r\n> \r\n> \"There are many different skills,\" she was saying. \"Sometimes it's best to coordinate with lots of other people who together can make the answers.\" The students nodded. Be a coordinator. That's where the biggest and most famous money was. But they also knew where Chumlig was going with this. She looked around the classroom, nodding that she knew they knew. \"Alas, you all intend to be top agents, don't you?\"\r\n> \r\n> \"It's what some of us will be.\" That was one of the Adult Ed students. Winston Blount was old enough to be Juan's great grandfather. When Blount had a bad day he liked to liven things up by harrassing Ms. Chumlig.\r\n> \r\n> The Search and Analysis instructor smiled back. \"It's about as likely as being a major league baseball star. The pure 'coordinating agent' is a rare type, Dean Blount.\"\r\n> \r\n> \"Some of us must be the administrators.\"\r\n> \r\n> \"Oh.\" Chumlig looked kind of sad for a moment, like she was figuring out how to pass on bad news. \"Administration has changed a lot, Dean Blount.\"\r\n> \r\n> Winston Blount sat back in his chair. \"Okay. So we have to learn some new tricks.\"\r\n> \r\n> \"Yes.\" Ms. Chumlig looked out over the class. \"That's an important point. This class is about search and analysis, the heart of the economy. We obviously need search and analysis as consumers. In almost all modern jobs, search and analysis are how we make our living. But, in the end, we must also know something about something.\"\r\n> \r\n> \"Meaning those courses we got C's in, right?\" That was a voice from the peanut gallery, probably someone who was physically truant.\r\n> \r\n> Chumlig sighed. \"Yes. Don't let those skills die. You've been exposed to them. Use them. Improve on them. You can do it with a special form of pre-analysis that I call 'study'.\"\r\n> \r\n> One of the students actually held up a hand. She was that old.\r\n> \r\n> \"Yes, Dr. Xiang?\"\r\n> \r\n> \"I know you are correct. But --\" The woman glanced around the room. She looked about Chumlig's age, not nearly as old as Winston Blount. But there was kind of a frightened look in her eyes. \"But some people are better than others. I'm not as sharp as I once was. Or maybe others are just sharper.... What happens if we try our hardest, and it just isn't good enough?\"\r\n> \r\n> Chumlig hesitated. How will she answer this! thought Juan. It was the real question. \"That's a problem that affects everyone, Dr. Xiang. Providence gives each of us our hand to play. In your case, you've got a new deal and a new start on life.\" Her look took in the rest of the class. \"Some of you think your hand in life is all deuces and treys.\" At the front of the room were some really dedicated students, not much older than Juan. They were wearing, but they had no clothes sense and had never learned ensemble coding. As Chumlig spoke, you could see their fingers tapping away, searching on \"deuces\" and \"treys\".\r\n> \r\n> \"But I have a theory of life,\" said Chumlig, \"and it is straight out of gaming: There is always an angle. You, each of you, have some special wild cards. Play with them. Find out what makes you different and better. Because it is there, if only you can find it. And once you do, you'll be able to contribute answers to others and others will be willing to contribute back to you. In short, synthetic serendipity doesn't just happen. By golly, you must create it.\"\r\n> \r\n> She hesitated, staring at invisible class notes, and her voice dropped down from oratory. \"So much for the big picture. Today, we're going to talk about morphing answerboard solutions. As usual, we're looking to ask the right questions.\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
